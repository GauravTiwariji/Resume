        Hello there! My name is Gaurav Tiwari, and I am a dedicated and ambitious student pursuing a B. Tech degree in Mechatronics and Robotics at Vilnius Technical University. Currently, I am in my third year of studies, set to graduate in July 2025.
    </p>
    <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong interest in the intersection of technology, engineering, and programming. I believe that the field of Mechatronics and Robotics offers immense potential to innovate and create solutions that can enhance various industries and improve people's lives.</p>
    <p>In addition to my university studies, I have also taken the initiative to expand my programming skills. From July 2022 to January 2023, I completed the Coding Ninjas C++ with DSA course, which has provided me with a solid foundation in C++ programming and data structures and algorithms. This course has honed my problem-solving abilities and equipped me with the necessary skills to tackle complex programming challenges.</p>
    <p>As I prepare to embark on my professional journey, I am currently focused on developing a comprehensive resume and portfolio that showcases my skills and expertise in the IT and web development fields. I am passionate about leveraging my knowledge in Mechatronics and Robotics along with my programming proficiency to contribute to projects that involve software development, web development, or any other areas within the IT industry.</p>
    <p>I possess a strong aptitude for learning new technologies and languages quickly, and I am eager to apply my theoretical knowledge and practical skills to real-world projects. My coursework and personal projects have provided me with hands-on experience in designing and implementing software solutions, as well as collaborating effectively with multidisciplinary teams.</p>
    <p>In addition to my technical abilities, I am a proactive and detail-oriented individual with excellent problem-solving and communication skills. I thrive in dynamic environments and enjoy taking on challenges that require creativity and innovation.</p>
    <p>I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the ever-evolving field of technology and make a meaningful impact. With my dedication, strong educational foundation, and passion for programming, I am confident that I can excel in IT or web development roles.</p>
